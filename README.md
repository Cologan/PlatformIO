In this Project i will be developing an ECG recorder. I will record ECG signals and analyze the recorded signals using the common methods of digital signal processing. Signal processing takes place both on a microcontroller and on a PC with Matlab.

Hardware: NodeMCU with ESP8266, OLED-Display and ECG-Shield with AD8232
