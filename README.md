In this Project i will be developing an ECG recorder. I will record ECG signals and analyze the recorded signals using the common methods of digital signal processing. Signal processing takes place both on a microcontroller and on a PC with Matlab.

Hardware: NodeMCU with ESP8266, OLED-Display and ECG-Shield with AD8232

Libraries used: 
1.  Arduino.h - Main include file for the Arduino SDK
2.  thingpulse/ESP8266 and ESP32 OLED driver for SSD1306 displays@^4.2.1
